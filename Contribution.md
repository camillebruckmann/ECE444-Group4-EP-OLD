# Contributing to Education Pathways
Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Your input will help make Education Pathways a more useful app for students. We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's to:

- Propose a new feature
- Report a bug
- Submit a fix
- Discuss the current state of the code

## We Develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same MIT License that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Accuracy and Reliability of Data
Ensure that all code you write does not cause the application to report inaccurate data, such as false course information. Education Pathways is a platform that students will rely on to plan their course schedules, so it is critical that the reliability of the website is maintained at a high standard.  

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/camillebruckmann/ECE444-Group4-EP/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/camillebruckmann/ECE444-Group4-EP/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
Ensure that when you write a bug report that you include a [reprex](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). 

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [An example stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that *anyone* with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
For this Project, we will be using coding guidelines from Python's official standards the [PEP8 Standard](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). You can easily check to see how close you are to the PEP8 Standard by using pylint!
